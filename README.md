1. There are nine folders under the main folder of this dataset, namely "country", "field", "forest", "indoor", "mountain", "oldbuilding", "street", "urban" and "water". Among them, "country" is used as the training set, and the other eight are used as test sets.
2. For the eight test subset folders, each pair of cross-spectral images to be registered contains five files: "xxxx_nir.jpg", "xxxx_nir.npy", "xxxx_nir.txt", "xxxx_nir_pa.txt", and "xxxx_rgb.jpg".
