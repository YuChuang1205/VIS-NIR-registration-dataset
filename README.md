# VIS-NIR registration dataset

### A brief introduction to the VIS-NIR registration dataset
This registration dataset is a VIS and NIR registration dataset that we construct based on the VIS-NIR scene dataset [[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5995637)]. It has 160 test sample pairs, which come from the first 20 pairs of each subset. The image pair to be registered is generated by performing an affine transformation including rotation, translation and scaling on the NIR images in the original registered image pair. Consistent with the experiments on the VIS-NIR patch dataset [[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7789530)], the experiments are trained on the “Country” subset and tested on the other eight subsets (Field, Forest, Indoor, Mountain, Oldbuilding, Street, Urban, Water). The dataset we made is available online.  

### Document interpretation 
   For the eight test subset folders, each pair of cross-spectral images to be registered contains five files: "xxxx_nir.jpg", "xxxx_nir.npy", "xxxx_nir.txt", "xxxx_nir_pa.txt", and "xxxx_rgb.jpg". The specific explanation is as follows:
1. **"xxxx_nir.jpg":** Reference NIR image;  
2. **"xxxx_rgb.jpg":** VIS image to be registered.  
3. **"xxxx_nir.txt":** Specific transformation parameters of the original NIR image.  
4. **"xxxx_nir_pa.txt":** specific affine transformation parameters corresponding to "xxxx_nir.txt". (That is, the affine transformation parameters that VIS images need to learn)   
5. **"xxxx_nir.npy":** equivalent to the content in "xxxx_nir_pa.txt", but the npy format is easier for the program to read.
